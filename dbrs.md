The Database Reference Stack provides flexibility to accommodate larger capacity deployments of Database applications, reduced hardware and operational costs, while maintaining required throughput and latency metrics. Intel® Optane™ DC Persistent Memory provides the advantage for larger available memory capacities and support for data persistence.

As with our other reference stacks, the Database Reference Stack is integrated, highly-performant, open source, and optimized for 2nd generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors and Intel® Optane™ DC Persistent Memory. This open source community release is part of an effort to ensure developers have easy access to the features and functionality of Intel Platforms.

Highly-tuned and built for cloud native environments, the release enables developers to quickly prototype by reducing complexity associated with integrating multiple software components, while still giving users the flexibility to customize their solutions.
